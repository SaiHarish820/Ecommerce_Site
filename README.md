# E-Commerce Site using MERN Stack

## Overview

Welcome to our collaborative project! This is an e-commerce site built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. We are excited to work together to create a feature-rich and user-friendly online shopping experience.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into client and server directories:

### Client

The `client` directory contains the React application, responsible for the front-end of the e-commerce site. We are using modern web development tools and libraries to ensure a responsive and engaging user interface.

### Server

The `server` directory contains the Node.js and Express.js server that powers the back-end of our e-commerce site. It handles authentication, database interactions, and other server-side functionalities.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-mern.git
   cd ecommerce-mern
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install client dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install server dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure the MongoDB connection string.

     Example `.env` file:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     ```

4. Run the development server:
   - In the `client` directory:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - In the `server` directory:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
